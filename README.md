# Kibble

**What is Kibble?**

Sometimes it can get confusing keeping track of when you fed your pet(s). This can especially get confusing when there are multiple people living in the house. Maybe your dog got feed too much or too little. You no longer have to ask your housemates whether your pet was fed or not, thanks to Kibble.

You can add your housemates to the app, and keep track of when your pet was fed and how many treats they got.
